# Binomial Fun!

You know what the best statistical distribution is? That's right, the Binomial. Nothing is more fundemental than a series of independent and identically distributed bernoulli trials. 

Unfortunately intervals estimating this wonderful distributions main parameter theta are not nearly as taught as ones for things like count data. This is a shame. 

This app is an attempt to clear up the confusion surrounding interval generation and hypothesis testing of everyones favorite collection of iid trials.
