### An Interactive Exploration of Binomial Confidence Intervals and Hypothesis Testing. 

---

__Introduction__


Confidence intervals (CIs) and hypothesis testing are two often misunderstood statistical techniques.  In addition, most efforts to teach confidence intervals and hypothesis testing in introductory statistics classes focus on data coming from normally distributed data. In this interactive online application I am attempting to help educate the user about not only the underlying nature of binomially distributed data, but also the behavior and properties of confidence intervals and hypothesis testing. 

__Motivation__

I have pursued an interactive application as it provides the ability to engage the user and also can be run on any device capable of accessing the internet and running javascript code. Principles from cognitive psycology such as the generation effect [1] also provide motivation to allow the user to interact with and observe the data being generated. 

__Methods__

The application is entirely coded in client-side javascript using the opensource library [d3](http://d3js.org/) and also a custom built statistics library. By making the visualization a static webpage it drasically eases the setup process and removes any black-box aspects from the client-visable code. 


__Future Direction__

I would eventually like to put together a series of interactive visualizations that help illustrate an entire introductory statistics curriculum. I have begun this with other visualizations such as [visualizing probability distribution transformations.](http://nickstrayer.me/distributionTransforms/) Excellent resources are available in print for students, but seeing concepts from multiple angles and tangibly interacting with them will hopefully provide a more lasting and thurough understanding of the material.
